            <h3>Why Ireland?</h3>
            <h2>Ireland, The Emerald Isle</h2>
            <p>
              Since it's first human settlement in 6000 BC, Ireland has had many
              periods of invasion and change in its civilian populations. This
              rich history and heritage has helped to shape Ireland (both north
              and south) into the unique country it is today.
              <br />
              William Drennan, Belfast-born medical innovator and initial
              leading force in the Society of United Irishmen, penned the poem,
              "When Erin first Rose". This poem contains the first appearance of
              the words, "the Emerald Isle" in reference to Ireland. The stanza
              reads:
              <br />"Alas! for poor Erin that some are still seen,<br />Who
              would dye the grass red from their hatred to green;<br />Yet, oh!
              when you're up, and they're down, let them live,<br />Then yield
              them that mercy which they would not give.<br />Arm of Erin, be
              strong! but be gentle as brave;<br />And uplifted to strike, be
              still ready to save;<br />Let no feeling of vengeance presume to
              defile<br />The cause of, or men of, the Emerald Isle."

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Alana and I traveled to Ireland in March/April of
              2024. I traveled to a few major cities in Southern Ireland and had
              a lovely time. I would highly recommend Ireland to anyone
              considering a trip.
