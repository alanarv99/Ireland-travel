            <h3>Why Ireland?</h3>
            <h2>Ireland, The Emerald Isle</h2>
            <p>
              Since it's first human settlement in 6000 BC, Ireland has had many
              periods of invasion and change in its civilian populations. This
              rich history and heritage has helped to shape Ireland (both north
              and south) into the unique country it is today.
              <br />
              William Drennan, Belfast-born medical innovator and initial
              leading force in the Society of United Irishmen, penned the poem,
              "When Erin first Rose". This poem contains the first appearance of
              the words, "the Emerald Isle" in reference to Ireland. The stanza
              reads:
              <br />"Alas! for poor Erin that some are still seen,<br />Who
              would dye the grass red from their hatred to green;<br />Yet, oh!
              when you're up, and they're down, let them live,<br />Then yield
              them that mercy which they would not give.<br />Arm of Erin, be
              strong! but be gentle as brave;<br />And uplifted to strike, be
              still ready to save;<br />Let no feeling of vengeance presume to
              defile<br />The cause of, or men of, the Emerald Isle."

                  A visit to the House of Waterford allows you to experience the
                  sheer divinity of fine crystal, as well as the masterful
                  techniques that create such opulent visions of beauty.

                <p>
                  This was a super fun stop in Waterford! I did the tour and
                  they bring you through the factory and show you each step that
                  goes into making their everyday pieces and their super
                  intricate specialty pieces.

                  Killarney National Park is described as a rugged, mountainous
                  sanctuary encompassing lakes, rivers, forests, lots of
                  waterfalls, and a myriad of historical sites. It also has a
                  fascinating and eventful history starting all the way back in
                  the early 17th century.

                  Truly one of the most beautful places on earth. The park is
                  massive and you are truly immersed in rolling hills of nature
                  and you come to understand the absolute beauty and magic that
                  is Ireland.

                  Literally a row of colourful houses lining the dockside, it’s
                  perhaps not the most exciting place to visit, but it is
                  arguably one of the most evocative parts of the city.

                <p>
                  I visited The Long Walk Twice. The first time was on a Ghost
                  of Galway Walking Tour; our guide told us the story of the
                  Claddagn Ghost which haunts the Long Walk. It was spooky! My
                  second visit was the next day and the view of the ocean from
                  the Long Walk was breathtaking to say the least.

            <p>
              Hi, my name is Alana and I traveled to Ireland in March/April of
              2024. I traveled to a few major cities in Southern Ireland and had
              a lovely time. I would highly recommend Ireland to anyone
              considering a trip.
